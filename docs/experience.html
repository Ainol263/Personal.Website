<div class="first">
<p><strong>Semester 1</strong>
<br>
<br>Got except to UiTM Kedah under course KIM120, Diploma in Library Management.
My groupmates, who always be there and keep supporting each other to success from the start till the end.
<br>
<br>Besides, I got the opportunity to go for study tours to Spritzer, Kopi Antong and Jeruk Madu Pak Ali company.
It is the best feeling ever because i got more and more knowledge that obviously outside of the box, or my course.
<br>
<br>At the same semester, I was accepted to my course club, known as ALiM. My position was 'Exco Sukan' together 
with Fareed and ZulFahmi.

<div class="second">
<p><strong>Semester 2</strong>
<br>
<br>Another great semester with them, ofcourse we were having some arguement that involving our heart feel.
The entire family ruin but got heal as soon as possible, we even got the opportunity to RAYA together! Yesh!
Spending some time to break fast together, laughing and assignment, never leave us hanging.
<br>
<br>Program conducted by my classmate, Zuraidi at Pusat Aktiviti Warga Emas, Sungai Petani. Where we spending time 
cleaning up surrounding of that building, decorating their 'sudut bacaan' and even take care some babies in the kindergarden.
<br>
<br>Having some fun time joining explore race from Perbadanan Perpustakaan Awam Kedah at Pekan Rabu, Alor Setar, Kedah.
We keep on running, feel exhausted and fun! Sometimes, <del>we even do some cheating method to get our job done!</del> And that is a secret

<div class="third">
<p><strong>Semester 3</strong> 
<br>
<br>Semester 3 is the best semester ever for me because my friends and I got a new responsibility which are becoming part of ALiM's club. 
Alhamdulillah, with the trust and vote from the previous MT, I got the name as Assistant Prez together with my Capt Prez, Zuraidi. At first,
it was tough but with guide from Kak Fiqa, we manage to handle it well. Alhamdulillah
<br>
<br>At the same month, once again I got an opportunity to conduct an team-building program, that limited for part 1 and part 2, Library Management 
students. <del>It's almost failed because the time-management and the schedule were problem, which create chaos in the middle of the field</del> but still
the program were ended well and remembered.
<br>
<br>Not to forget that my friends and I participate in Indelib 2019 program where my teams presented our last semester project, which from Multimedia subject.
It is about edutainment project, about dinosaur and some game that will entertain kids. The Indelib 2019 placed at Pulau Pinang, where we can enjoy some view from 
the bridge and the beach near with the hotel.
<br>
<br>Not to forget the internship in <abbr title="Perbadanan Perpustakaan Awam Selangor">PPAS</abbr> with my partner, Liyana from class KIM1203C. We only got 6 weeks 
to become their family. At first, it was so awkward because the me <sub>the most shy person in the world when meet up with a new person</sub>, must take time to feel 
calm and friendly. But for the employee there, they treat us like we know for a long time ago, without any strict voice or else, we were like their kids.<sup>I hope so hehe</sup>.
Perhaps, I got a new friends which actually they are a year or two older than me. They from UiTM Jasin, UiTM Puncak Perdana, UPM and UPSI. 
For your information, that is the first time I personally meet up with 'Pengarah' PPAS,Puan Mastura Hj Muhamad, and it is an honor for us to listen for her advice and saying that she will always open up
their arms, to accept us as intern student nor employee someday.

<p><strong>Semester 4</strong> 
<br>
<br>On the first week of semester 4, unfortunately, Capt Prez were sick and could not give a full commitment to ALiM. So, here I am, volunteer myself to work as Miss Prez and continue the journey of Capt Prez.
Actually, I am not really sure how this semester will end and I am not sure how I can handle ALiM alone, <del>except lecturers ofcourse</del>. But with support from other members in club and even classmates, 
Alhamdulillah, until now, I still continue the journey. At first, I let it be a secret especially from the new intake (part 1) because we were having a camp, kind like motivation camp for them to get ready to 
become university student. It was fun! Eventhough I have migraine, ergh. But then, on March I officially announce myself as the new president ALiM to them. It was ashame but still I need to do it. I do it for 
lecturers, Capt Prez and other members.

And now, I am on my last semester for my diploma! Hurray, Diploma in Library Management is fun. Eventhough it was tough but, it teach me different way to gain knowledge,
hardwork with groupmate to submit the assignment and many more! Even we have curriculum just the same with our school life style but the instructor are different than before.
We were teach about survival, TTS and many more! UiTM Kedah is the best place <del>but still far from home huhu</del></font></p>
